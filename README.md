# About this project
The contents of this GitHub repository are used to build http://robo.fyi.
This project aims to collect together a variety of information within the hobbyist space with respect to 3D printers, their use, tips/tricks, sources for parts, how-to's regarding dissassembly/re-assembly and troubleshooting. The initial focus will be to document the collection of printers created by Robo 3D. It may be a later intent to monetize this with available affiliate programs within the vendorspace but that's not planned soon.

# Installation
This is a classic Node.js app using Express and Bootstrap for styling. I assume that you have `git` and `Node.js` already installed. The commands below work on Linux and OS X in a terminal sessionâ€”for Windows, you'll want to just enter the URL into your browser manually on that final step.

```
$ cd sites
$ git clone https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/robo.fyi.git
$ cd robo.fyi
$ npm install
$ DEBUG=robo.fyi:* npm start
$ open http://localhost:3000
```

# Reporting Issues & Making Suggestions
If you've spotted an error, omission or have a suggestion, raise an [issue](https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/robo.fyi/issues). Feedback on every aspect of the site or this repository is welcome.

# Contributing
I'll work up a process for the preferred method for making contributions. We're not quite there, yet.

# Roadmap & wishlist
* Create an artistic, responsive website from the main page and drill into specific printer subsections
* Create a compelling/interactive interface for viewing and then drilling down into subassemblies
* Create an organized method of storing the underlying source data for available replacement parts
